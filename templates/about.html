   <p>This project takes images using the Pi Camera and the new picamera2 library. The OpenVINO toolkit by Intel is used to classify images, recognize vehicles or detect text.</p>
   <p>This project also uses pretrained models from the Open Model Zoo to detect text, classify images or recognize vehicles.</p>
   <p>To get started, make sure to have 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye installed on your Pi. This has been tested on the Pi 4 and should work on the Pi 3B+. This will be tested on the Pi 5 and 64-bit Pi OS Bookworm. The Pi Camera module will also be needed (any camera module will work). Also be sure to have the Intel NCS2 available. A camera mount is recommended if you want to make this project portable.</p>
   <p>Next, have the OpenVINO toolkit installed. This <a href="https://gist.github.com/sentairanger/caf11a2432ceebd715c6b33c224f4960" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guide</a> helps you install OpenVINO. Be sure to follow all of the instructions given. Also be sure to have the NCS2 inserted into a USB port after installing the toolkit.</p>
